4 a.m.
Raging heart and I feel like I'm a child again
Neon streets
I'm so high I can't quiet my bionic mind

North star, I need you to guide me home

I need help
I've seen bad things and I cannot make them disappear
I want flesh to bring me happiness 'cause I feel nothing
I feel nothing

North star, I need you to guide me home (North star)

It's the blue hour again
In the world there is a horror of plagues
Do you still love me?

Stand tall, shoulders back
Feeling brave
Who am I? (Who am I?)
Who am I? (North star)

Reprogramme
Repeat
Reprogramme
Repeat
I am real
I am good
I am real
I am good

North star
